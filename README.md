# Calculator Project

My first Python mini-project: A basic calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## What I Learned:
- Python basics
- If-else statements
- Functions
- User input
- GitHub repo creation

## Next Steps:
- Add error handling
- Improve UI (maybe with tkinter or web version)
- Upload more projects!
